# This is an example messages file. Store it in the root of the external
# storage directory and BusMan will read and use it. Example
#   adb shell mkdir /sdcard/BusMan
#   adb push BusManMessages /sdcard/BusMan
#
# There are 3 types of messages:
#   Welcome messages, for arrivals while adding to the manifest
#   format: w/timeRegexp/idRegexp/message/weight
#
#   Returning messages, for arrivals while dropping from the manifest
#   format: r/timeRegexp/idRegexp/message/isLast/weight
#
#   "Go" messages, when the last entry has been removed from the manifest
#   format: g/timeRegexp/message/weight
#
#  The first field identifies the type of message (w is welcome, etc.)
#  timeRegexp is a regular expression to match against a time/date string of the form
#          "Sun, Mar 23, 2014 14:07"
#          ex: /.*Apr 01.*/ matches April first; empty matches all)
#  idRegexp is a regular expression to match against a rider id, or empty to match all riders
#  message is the string, which can contain:
#           "%s" where the name is to be inserted
#           "!locale(language)" where language is an ISO locale string, e.g., en_GB
#               (without a !locale, the default locale language will be spoken)
#  isLast is either "t", signifying that this matches a returning rider who is the last rider;
#          "f" signifies someone who is NOT the last rider; and empty matches all
#  weight is the selection weight. Among all matching messages, a message's weight divided by
#          the sum of all matching messages' weights represents the probability that a given
#          message will be selected. If weight is empty, it defaults to a value of 10.
#
#  NOTE: empty lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored
